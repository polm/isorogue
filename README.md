# Isorogue

Made for the 2017 7DRL by 23 (@polm) & @chamotea. Download the release over [here](https://23.itch.io/isorogue).

## Controls

- move with arrow keys (up = up-right)
- use [/] to turn pages in your monster book on the right

## Goal

- get through 12 stages alive
- collect all the monster parts by understanding biorhythms

## Biorhythms

- each monster has a hidden "biorhythm"
- at certain points in their rhythm they'll glow a color
- if you hit them when they glow the right color they drop an item

For easy monsters, glowing any color besides gray means they'll drop an item.
They also glow gray one turn before they're ready to drop so you have some
warning. For harder monster's you'll have to pay attention and try different
colors to get everything!
